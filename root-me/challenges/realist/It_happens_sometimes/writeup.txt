CHECK the http://challenge01.root-me.org/realiste/ch3/admin link and then use Burpsuite to intercept connexion
Then change in the "Repeater" the GET method for PUT

OTHER SOLUTION:

with curl (on linux), you can use the query 'OPTIONS' (that is not filtered)

curl --request OPTIONS http://challenge01.root-me.org/realiste/ch3/admin/

And then it's ok
